A large majority of your classes, methods, test cases, and web page navigation should be implemented by milestone 3, as well.

* **Mar 27** - The **midterm exam** will be in-class on **Friday, 4-3-20**.  It will be open notes and you can use any resource on the CS320 website, as well as your lab solutions.  A practice exam is posted.  The exam will be 120 points, and it will be difficult to finish in the time allotted, if you do not know the material.  It will graded on a 100 point basis, thus it has a built-in 20-point curve.  You can choose which questions to concentrate your effort on, but all questions will be graded.  We will use Wednesday, 4-1-20 for a short review for the midterm exam.

* **Mar 27** - Posted an extensive example project on the [Resources page](./resources) that incorporates the Web Applications lab solution (Lab02) with the ORM Lab solution (Lab06).  It provides a web application front-end to the ORM queries, as well as demonstrates the use of login session information, and incorporation of a SQL database persistence layer with a many-to-many relationship. We will review this in more depth in class on **Monday, 4-6-20**.

There is **NO** expectation for having any of your SQL database implemented or working.

You can download the jarfile from the [Resources Page](resources/index.html).  You may also use other drawing tools, **as long as those tools can export PDF versions of the UML diagram**, which you willl need to embed in your Assign06 submission.
